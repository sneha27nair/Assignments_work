    "- Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently. The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.\n",

    "- In Python, the multiprocessing module includes a very simple and intuitive API for dividing work between multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In multiprocessing, any newly created process will do following:\n",

    "- Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) only allows one thread to be run at a time under the interpreter, which means you can’t enjoy the performance benefit of multithreading if the Python interpreter is required. This is what gives multiprocessing an upper hand over threading in Python. Multiple processes can be run in parallel because each process has its own interpreter that executes the instructions allocated to it. Also, the OS would see your program in multiple processes and schedule them separately, i.e., your program gets a larger share of computer resources in total. So, multiprocessing is faster when the program is CPU-bound. In cases where there is a lot of I/O in your program, threading may be more efficient because most of the time, your program is waiting for the I/O to complete. However, multiprocessing is generally more efficient because it runs concurrently.\n",

    "- multithreading (middle diagram), multiple threads share the same code, data, and files but run on a different register and stack. Multiprocessing (right diagram) multiplies a single processor — replicating the code, data, and files, which incurs more overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multithreading is useful for IO-bound processes, such as reading files from a network or database since each thread can run the IO-bound process concurrently. Multiprocessing is useful for CPU-bound processes, such as computationally heavy tasks since it will benefit from having multiple processors; similar to how multicore computers work faster than computers with a single core.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, multiprocessing can be used for IO-bound processes. However, overhead for managing multiple processes is higher than managing multiple threads as illustrated above. You may notice that multiprocessing might lead to higher CPU utilization due to multiple CPU cores being used by the program, which is expected."
