    "- In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, Python interrupts the normal flow of the program and raises an exception object. This object contains information about the error, such as the type of exception, the location where the error occurred, and a traceback of the call stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are a way of handling errors in a program and can be caught and handled using try and except statements. This allows the program to recover from errors and continue running, rather than crashing and terminating.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors are errors that occur when the Python interpreter is unable to parse the code due to a violation of the language syntax rules. Syntax errors are usually detected by the interpreter during the parsing phase, before the code is executed. Syntax errors occur when there is a mistake in the code, such as a missing colon, a missing parenthesis, or a typo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of the code, while syntax errors occur during the parsing phase, before the code is executed. Syntax errors are usually easy to detect and fix, as the interpreter provides a clear error message that points to the exact location of the error. Exceptions, on the other hand, can be more complex to diagnose and handle, as they can occur at different points in the code and can be caused by a variety of factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of the program, while syntax errors are errors that occur during the parsing phase, before the code is executed. Handling exceptions is an important part of writing robust and reliable Python code."
