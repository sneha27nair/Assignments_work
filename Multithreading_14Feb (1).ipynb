Each item in the list is a reference to a thread object, and the list can be useful for iterating over all the active threads and performing some action on each one. For example, you might use enumerate() to join all the threads in a program before exiting, or to check the status of each thread and take some action based on its status."

    "\n",

When the join() method is called, the program waits until the thread has finished executing before continuing with the rest of the program. This can be useful for coordinating the execution of multiple threads, for example, to make sure that one thread has completed its work before another thread begins.\n",

When the isAlive() method is called, it returns True if the thread is currently executing, and False otherwise.
